> Try Google fonts in style

I made this because I love Google fonts and beautiful colors.  
The website lets you try out all of Google fonts with multiple color combinations.
You could use it pick a font for your startup logo or tag-line and test it with awesome color pallets.
It lets you search for Google fonts, change the canvas color, text color and also font size & weight/style.

No logins or registrations needed! 

If this gets any traction I plan on adding more features like:
- Move it to its own domain
- Background photos from Unsplash
- Icons from The Noun Project
- Downloading your finished design
- Short URL sharing
- Make it look better on mobile
- And many more features
